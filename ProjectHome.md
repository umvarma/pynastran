## pyNastran has Moved (3/12/2015) ##
Google Code is [closing down](http://google-opensource.blogspot.com/2015/03/farewell-to-google-code.html) on January 25, 2016 and as such pyNastran is moving to [github](https://github.com/SteveDoyle2/pynastran).  New commits will be made there.

Additionally, a long awaited new release (v0.7) is coming soon.  The target is sometime withing the next month.  There are many improvements such as:
  * OP2 superelement support
  * vectorized OP2 support (uses much less memory; not implemented for Element Forces)
  * additional OP2 tables
  * improved F06 reader (OP2 reader is still better)
  * 20 new BDF cards
  * much improved GUI with transient support (real only), a results sidebar, logging, and scripting support

As always there are many bug fixes and many new tests.
